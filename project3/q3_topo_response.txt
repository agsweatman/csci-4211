Section 3
Is it possible for you to estimate the throughput and latency of individual
links between switches, viz, L1, L2, L3 and L4?

Yes. Latency can be estimated using ping. The approximate latency along a link
is half of the average round-trip time for a ping, since one round trip requires
traversing the link twice. The latency along each link can be estimated by
measuring average ping delay between two machines connected by the link.
Throughput over a link can be estimated using iperf between two hosts separated
by the link. Estimated latencies and throughputs for each link are as follows:

L1: 40ms, 20mbps
L2: 10ms, 40mbps
L3: 20ms, 30mbps
L4: 30ms, 20mbps

Output for each of the commands we used to estimate values can be found in
q3_topo_output.txt.
