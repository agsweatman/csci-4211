Section 1

1. Detailed information of the data structures and its purpose.

The only data structure we maintain is a map from MAC addresses to port numbers. Its purpose is to match packets' destinations to outgoing interfaces of the switch.

2. Pseudo code which specifies how your algorithm works, how the internal data structures are used and updated, which fields from the packets/events are used by your logic.

function _handlePacketIn(event)
  mac_to_port[event.packet.src] = event.port
  if event.packet.dst is a key in mac_to_port
    push a flow entry to the switch to forward packets matching this one through port mac_to_port[event.packet.dst]
    send received packet out port mac_to_port[event.packet.dst]
  else
    broadcast packet to every port except event.port
